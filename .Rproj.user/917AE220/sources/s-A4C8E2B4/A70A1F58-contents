## An extremely short into to Signal detection theory (SDT)

  - SDT provides separate measures of sensitivity and bias bias (Green & Swets, 1966).
  - _d'_ is a measure of sensitivity or discriminability
  - criterion, often stated as _c_, is a measure of bias

## Stream/bounce effect: perceptual of decisional process? 


Two objects moving towards each other are more likely to be perceived as bouncing than as streaming if a sound is presented at the moment the objects meet (Sekuler, Sekuler, & Lau, 1997). 

In Grove, Ashton, ... (2012) the effect was deemed to be result of a decisional processes because an effect was observed in _c_ rather than _d'_.


## Signal detection theory (SDT)

  - SDT provides separate measures of sensitivity and bias bias (Green & Swets, 1966).
  - Sensitivity can be:
      - perceptual sensitivity
      - memory sensitivity
      - etc.
  - Bias can be:
      - perceptual bias
      - memory bias
      - response bias
      - etc.
